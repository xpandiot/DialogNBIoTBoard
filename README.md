# Repo Details

This repository is for the beginners who are using the SIM7000 based ideamart devboard and can also be used for any Arduino with SIM7000 module

*Download the 'libraries' folder and extract the contents to your default Arduino Libraries folder. Please replace if already existing.

*Download the SDK and then change the parameters in the 'XpandIoT_SIM7000_SDK' tab according to your device definitions and create your event in 'your_actions_events' tab . Set Board to Arduino/Guneino UNO if above board is being used in arduino IDE
